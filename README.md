# LANDSLIDES-
The basic idea of our system is enabling the user to
know whether a landslide can occur in a particular loc‚Äê
ation or not. We are collecting the data regarding the
landslides that have occurred in the past few decades
based on which, we have created a criteria to judge
the parameters of a upcoming landslide. We have
randomly taken the data of some of the past occurred
landslides around the globe where our parameters are
rainfall, elevation and type of soil. So what we have
done is we have coded a program which checks the
data interpreted according to the location provided
by the user and a range has been created for each of
the parameter. If the values of different parameters
fall in our range then the site will automatically give a
approximate chances of occurrence of a landslide.
